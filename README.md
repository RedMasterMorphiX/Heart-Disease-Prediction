Heart Disease is becoming common now a day among each and every person whether he is Student or Working Person. Most common among them is Heart Stoke. All the heart related problems are very complex, and requires complex combination of pathological and clinical data. For researchers to predict accurately the disease is important. I have created a model for the prediction of heart disease that can help many medical professionals in predicting whether the person will be having any heart related issue based on the clinical data. My approach started with selecting important clinical features i.e., Age, Pains in body, Blood Pressure, Blood sugar level etc. After that I have developed algorithms based on the data for achieving high accuracy and precision. Finally, I devloped a user efficient heart disease predict model (HDPM). Model will be displaying Graph for the Prediction, Prediction performance (execute time, accuracy, specificity, and predicted result). This model will be used in classification of heart disease.
